Why Django templates?

Using Django templates protects you against the majority of XSS attacks.

Django templates escape specific characters which are particularly dangerous to HTML.

# security headers implemented

My site received A+ on https://securityheaders.com/

# URL link
https://enigmatic-tundra-85410.herokuapp.com/

connecting first time can sometimes take a while because the site wakes up on the first connection (free tier)

# Dependency update
Keeping a second copy from the code on the link below on github so that dependabot can daily check it and mail me when irregularities are found.

# Access control policy
superuser: admin - password: student2

full access to everything -> will automatically be redirected to admin panel on login

logged in user will have access to New meeting tab and add new meetings

not logged in can just see planned meetings and the available rooms

#reCAPTCHA info
Added recaptcha security from Google.

Alternative to throttling, that gives a better user experience.

Google AI will scan your form for malicious intent
